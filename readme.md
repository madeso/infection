This is a old project in C from 2004, uploaded here mostly for publicly shaming myself of the horrible code I promised myself to never write again.

Source is licensed under LGPL, though I wouldn't recomend touching it with a stick.
All files in files belongs to the original creators or whoever holds the rights and are here only for the crazies that feel they need to run the horrible and unfinished game. If I uploaded your files without your consent, I'm sorry.
